# Exercise 4:
# If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you'd like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

guests = ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David", "Eve"]
print(f"Hello {guests[0]}, would you like to join me for dinner?")
print(f"Hello {guests[1]}, would you like to join me for dinner?")
print(f"Hello {guests[2]}, would you like to join me for dinner?")
print(f"Hello {guests[3]}, would you like to join me for dinner?")
print(f"Hello {guests[4]}, would you like to join me for dinner?")
