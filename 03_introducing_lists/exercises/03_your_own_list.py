# Exercise 3:
# Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as "I would like to own a Honda motorcycle."

transportation = ["car", "motorcycle", "bicycle", "bus", "train"]
print(f"I would like to own a {transportation[0]}.")
print(f"I would like to own a {transportation[1]}.")
print(f"I would like to own a {transportation[2]}.")
print(f"I would like to own a {transportation[3]}.")
print(f"I would like to own a {transportation[4]}.")
