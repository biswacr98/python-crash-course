# Exercise 6:
# Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.

# - Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
# - Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit is in your list. If the fruit is in your list, the if block should print a statement, such as You really like bananas!

favorite_fruits = ['banana', 'apple', 'orange']

if 'banana' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like bananas!")

if 'apple' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like apples!")

if 'orange' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like oranges!")

if 'kiwi' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like kiwis!")

if 'grape' in favorite_fruits:
    print("You really like grapes!")
