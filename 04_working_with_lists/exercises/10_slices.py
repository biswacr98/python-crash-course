# Exercise 10:
# Using one of the programs you wrote in this chapter, add several lines to the end of the program that do the following:
# - Print the message The first three items in the list are:. Then use a slice to print the first three items from that programâ€™s list.
# - Print the message Three items from the middle of the list are:. Use a slice to print three items from the middle of the list.
# - Print the message The last three items in the list are:. Use a slice to print the last three items in the list.

numbers = list(range(1,1000001))

print("The first three items in the list are:")
print(numbers[:3])

print("Three items from the middle of the list are:")
middle = len(numbers) // 2
print(numbers[middle-1:middle+2])

print("The last three items in the list are:")
print(numbers[-3:])
