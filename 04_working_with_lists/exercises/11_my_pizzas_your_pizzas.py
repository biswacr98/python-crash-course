# Exercise 11:
# Start with your program from Exercise 1. Make a copy of the list of pizzas, and call it friend_pizzas. Then, do the following:
# - Add a new pizza to the original list.
# - Add a different pizza to the list friend_pizzas.
# - Prove that you have two separate lists. Print the message My favorite pizzas are:, and then use a for loop to print the first list. Print the message My friendâ€™s favorite pizzas are:, and then use a for loop to print the second list. Make sure each new pizza is stored in the appropriate list.

pizzas = ['pepperoni', 'margherita', 'hawaiian']
friend_pizzas = pizzas[:]

pizzas.append('pineapple')

friend_pizzas.append('butterchicken')

print("My favorite pizzas are:")
for pizza in pizzas:
    print(pizza.title())

print("\nMy friend's favorite pizzas are:")
for pizza in friend_pizzas:
    print(pizza.title())
