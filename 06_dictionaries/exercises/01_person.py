# Exercise 1:

# Use a dictionary to store information about a person you know. Store their first name, last name, age, and the city in which they live. You should have keys such as first_name, last_name, age, and city. Print each piece of information stored in your dictionary.

person = {
    'first_name': 'John',
    'last_name': 'Doe',
    'age': 30,
    'city': 'New York'
}

print(person['first_name'])
print(person['last_name'])
print(person['age'])
print(person['city'])

# Output:
# John
# Doe
# 30
# New York
